## Data Analyst Internship at MedTourEasy

### Project: Analyze Death Age Difference of Right Handers with Left Handers

This project was undertaken as part of my internship at MedTourEasy. As a Data Analyst Intern, I completed the Google Data Analytics certification. Subsequently, I was tasked with conducting an analysis on the death age difference between right-handers and left-handers.

### Project Overview

- **Objective**: To analyze the death age difference between right-handers and left-handers using statistical operations, including probability prediction using Bayes' Equation.
- **Project Link**: [Analyze Death Age Difference of Right Handers with Left Handers](https://github.com/ukishore33/Analyze-Death-Age-Difference-of-Right-Handers-with-Left-Handers/blob/main/Analyze_Death_Age_Difference_of_Right_Handers_with_Left_Handers_ipynb.ipynb)

### Project Steps

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**: We began by importing the required Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.

2. **Data Import**: The dataset necessary for the analysis was imported into the notebook.

3. **Probability Calculation for Left-handers**: We calculated the probability of left-handers in the population using statistical methods.

4. **Prediction of Right-handers Population**: Utilizing the same function, we predicted the population of right-handers, employing Bayes' Equation for probability estimation.

5. **Calculation of Difference in Probabilities**: We computed the difference between the probabilities of left-handers and right-handers for the current period and the year 2012.

6. **Visualization of Results**: The results were visualized using appropriate graphs and charts to facilitate understanding.

### Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the death age difference between right-handers and left-handers, showcasing the practical application of statistical analysis in real-world scenarios. It also enhanced my skills in data analysis and visualization, contributing to my growth as a data analyst.
