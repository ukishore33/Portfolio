## Machine Learning Internship

During my tenure as a Machine Learning Intern, I engaged in two significant projects:

### Minor Project: BigMart Outlet Sales Analysis and Prediction

The objective of this data science project was to construct a predictive model to estimate the sales of each product at specific stores.

### Major Project: Building Machine Learning Pipeline - Start-up Acquisition Dataset

In the major project, we delved into the process of building a machine learning pipeline using the start-up acquisition dataset. The project was divided into several steps:

1. **Data Understanding**: Understanding the structure and content of the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, outliers, etc.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset to gain insights and identify patterns.
4. **Model Creation**: Developing machine learning models for classification tasks.
5. **Creating Pipelines and Deployment**: Building pipelines to streamline the workflow and deploying the model for practical use.

This project involved collaborative efforts from team members and spanned three months, from September 15, 2023, to December 15, 2023.

These projects provided invaluable hands-on experience in machine learning techniques, data analysis, and project management, contributing significantly to my growth as a machine learning practitioner.
